# MicroKernelOS

Welcome to my **microkernel-based operating system** project! This repository contains the source code and related files I developed as part of my academic work. Due to licensing and school policies, some files have been encrypted and are not publicly available in this repository. However, the unencrypted files listed below are my own work, and they are provided for demonstration purposes.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Below is a brief overview of the structure of this repository, focusing on the unencrypted files:

### **Unencrypted Files**
These files represent my own contributions and are accessible in their original form:
- **`lib/util`**: General utility functions developed to support various components of the system.
- **`lib/mm/mm.c`**: Implements the memory management subsystem for the microkernel.
- **`lib/aos/paging.c`**: Contains the paging implementation for address space management.
- **`lib/grading/tests/test_paging.c`**: A test suite designed to verify the correctness of the paging subsystem.
- **`lib/hashtable/hashtable.c`**: Implements a custom hashtable for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### **Encrypted Files**
All other files in this repository have been encrypted to comply with licensing and school policies. These files are part of the broader system but cannot be distributed publicly.

## üîë Accessing Encrypted Files

The encrypted files in this repository are not directly accessible. If you're part of the academic institution or otherwise authorized to access the full codebase, please contact me directly for further details.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Navigate

Since many files have been encrypted, here are a few tips for navigating the repository:
1. Focus on the **`lib/`** directory, which contains the unencrypted source files mentioned above.
2. Explore the **tests** in `lib/grading/tests` to see how I verified the functionality of key components.
3. For general-purpose utilities, see the **`lib/util`** folder.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features of the Unencrypted Files

### **1. Memory Management (`lib/mm/mm.c`)**
- Implements low-level memory allocation and deallocation.
- Handles slab allocators, page allocators, and other fundamental memory operations.

### **2. Paging Subsystem (`lib/aos/paging.c`)**
- Provides support for virtual memory through paging.
- Includes mapping functions and page fault handlers.

### **3. Hashtable Implementation (`lib/hashtable/hashtable.c`)**
- Custom hashtable designed for efficient key-value storage.
- Used in various subsystems for fast lookup and insertion.

### **4. Test Suite (`lib/grading/tests/test_paging.c`)**
- Contains test cases to verify the correctness of the paging subsystem.
- Demonstrates the robustness and reliability of the implementation.

### **5. Utilities (`lib/util`)**
- Collection of helper functions used across multiple modules.
- Simplifies debugging, logging, and general-purpose operations.

## üîç How to Explore the Code
1. **Start with `README.md`:** Provides an overview of the repository structure and highlights key components.
2. **Navigate to `lib/`:** Focus on the subdirectories to see the unencrypted source code.
3. **Run Tests:** Use the test files in `lib/grading/tests` to understand the expected behavior of key features.
